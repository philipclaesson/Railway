#Railway

#This was done for an old Spotify Coding Challenge that was available on Kattis.com. 

The task was to find a shortest cycle in a set of threeway connections (railway), and if such a cycle exists, return the name of the connections. 

The code uses a modified BDF search. Was created in early 2016, before I knew much about Time Complexity, and has not been changed since.
